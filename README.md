# McJerry: Asthma Tracker for Children
McJerry is a kid-friendly Android app that helps children (ages 6–16) understand asthma, practice good inhaler technique, log symptoms/medicine use, and share parent-approved information with a healthcare provider via a concise, exportable report.

McJerry believes in helping individuals understand and stay in control of their medical conditions regardless of age and ability, and this is reflected in our app's equitable design.
